0,I’m all for a Harriet monument. Good for her. It does feel like a monument replacing Columbus should be a native american figure though. Still Harriet is obviously much more worthy of memorialization than that genocidal maniac. Good move for them.,"{'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.712, 'pos': 0.227, 'compound': 0.8122}",Positive,50.0,20.0,30.0,0.15874

4,"Harriet Tubman really is probably the single most inspiring person in American history. To not only escape slavery, but then to come back and help more people get out, is bravery, selflessness, and heroism almost unprecedented in world history.

And did it all while suffering from a traumatic brain injury as a child that caused her to experience seizures for all her life, that could paralyze her for hours at a time.","{'neg': 0.15, 'neu': 0.666, 'pos': 0.185, 'compound': 0.5177}",Positive,,,,
