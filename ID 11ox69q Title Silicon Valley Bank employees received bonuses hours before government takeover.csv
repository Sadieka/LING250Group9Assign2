0,"Having worked there, I'm fucking laughing at all the comments. This place has been a fucking dumpster fire for years. Can't wait until BNP Paribas gets shut down next. 

Fuck these banks. Fuck the cartels, Al Quaida/ ISIS and Saudi Royal family that bank at these banks.... Wait, we're not supposed to hold accounts for PEPs.... Ok, start a fucking fake business in the caymens and pay yourself from that. 

Anyone who defends them defends North Korean fuck face generals, Russia oligarchs (so many Russian & Ukrainian dating websites bank with SVB), child soldiers in Africa (it's just a tech start-up for wheat in Sudan) or a NGO in Angola......


ALL of the middle to high up management knows about all that shit! They submit just enough (or they thought they submitted just enough)  SARS to keep them off their backs....


Long story short. Fuck you Greg in Tempe off Rio Salado. Fuck all the managers from Charles'Schwab who work/ed there. 

I'm upset because none of them will serve time in prison. They will all get jobs at any other bank in days. They are why this world sucks for honest people. Fuck them so much","{'neg': 0.191, 'neu': 0.779, 'pos': 0.03, 'compound': -0.9873}",Negative,20.0,60.0,20.0,-0.34437000000000006

3,"I love the panic that comes from everything now. Itâ€™s like business donâ€™t fail every day. Donâ€™t get me wrong this is indeed a huge fucking deal but unless you have some sort of certificate or degree in this stuff you really donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen. Even the people who know everything about the financial district donâ€™t really know exactly whatâ€™s gunna happen so can everyone just chill out for one Sunday and weâ€™ll get back to the (slow, very slow) collapse of civilization Monday morning?","{'neg': 0.114, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': -0.7325}",Negative,,,,
4,Cash out before you crash out! Lol. Seems like this should have been expected. The basic employees didn't do anything wrong.

5,"So there a bunch of dodgy shit going on.... what a fucking surprise from a bank. 


We need to bring extreme regulation with thw harshest punishment known to man(every bank in the civilized world not just the USA).
