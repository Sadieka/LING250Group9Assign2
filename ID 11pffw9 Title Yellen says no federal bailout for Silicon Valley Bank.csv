2,"It's so odd seeing so many wanting a bailout. And yes covering the depositors is a bailout. It was the same argument in 08 that was bad then and bad now. Banks need to bleed a little here and learn they cant keep ignoring their greedy high risk moves knowing they will get bailed out. Depositors also need to learn the lesson that putting all your money into one bank is dumb. This will just keep happening and in bigger allotments if it isn't left alone to die.

No bailouts.","{'neg': 0.258, 'neu': 0.682, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': -0.9638}",Negative,,,,

5,"And the Gov shouldn't. This is Capitalism at work, there's no chance in hell that depositors and VC's weren't aware of what an unisured creditor was, and the risk it carries. Secured creditors will recieve their $250k this coming week, unsecured creditors are getting certificates and will recieve proceeds from the sale of SVB's assets as they are liquidated, exactly as expected for *unsecured creditors of a failed bank. W*elcome to Capitalism and Investing. VC's and start-up execs should have done due diligence and taken appropriate steps just like anyone else is expected to when investing.

A start-up CFO with 50M seed money for payroll could easily have put those funds into a stepped ladder of treasury bills to. mature when payroll or expected expenses were due rather than sitting 50M of liquid funds in a bank account secured only up to $250k. Poor risk and financial management from VC's and the start-up execs - will they learn from this, probably not. 

VC's and Equity investors can also look at their investments, evaluate the winners and losers and pick and choose which to continue floating through this period. Thats  how Capitalism works. Anyone pushing for a bailout is necessary to protect individual workers is completely disengenuous to the situation- fundementally the risk has been predictable to anyone who chose to review SVB's financial statements and there is no reason at all for tax payers to bail out VC's for execrising poor oversight of their investments. Must've missed the disclaimer that investing is inherently risky and carries the chance of a loss of investment while spending all day reviewing start-ups and investments to park their venture capital into...that must be embarassing. 

And no, Bill Akerman is entirely off the mark that this will cause a run on regional banks Monday AM, the fucking loony.","{'neg': 0.122, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.9376}",Negative,,,,

7,16th largest bank. Do you need to be in the top 10 to get bailouts? And could you let us know which will get bailouts in advance so we can be sure to leave our over 250k funds there?,"{'neg': 0.029, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.504}",Positive,,,,
8,"It's kinda funny to see all the tech bros who go to SV to find a company that is going to ""disrupt the market"", which ever one it might be now begging for bailouts when for the innocent workers who have been disrupted for the last 40 years got nothing. 

It's capitalism, you took a risk to hit it big and it didn't work out. It's time to take your lumps and move on to the next project. Good Luck!@","{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.127, 'compound': 0.8442}",Positive,,,,
