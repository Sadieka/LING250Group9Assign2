3,"It's so odd seeing so many wanting a bailout. And yes covering the depositors is a bailout. It was the same argument in 08 that was bad then and bad now. Banks need to bleed a little here and learn they cant keep ignoring their greedy high risk moves knowing they will get bailed out. Depositors also need to learn the lesson that putting all your money into one bank is dumb. This will just keep happening and in bigger allotments if it isn't left alone to die.

6,"And the Gov shouldn't. This is Capitalism at work, there's no chance in hell that depositors and VC's weren't aware of what an unisured creditor was, and the risk it carries. Secured creditors will recieve their $250k this coming week, unsecured creditors are getting certificates and will recieve proceeds from the sale of SVB's assets as they are liquidated, exactly as expected for *unsecured creditors of a failed bank. W*elcome to Capitalism and Investing. VC's and start-up execs should have done due diligence and taken appropriate steps just like anyone else is expected to when investing.

A start-up CFO with 50M seed money for payroll could easily have put those funds into a stepped ladder of treasury bills to. mature when payroll or expected expenses were due rather than sitting 50M of liquid funds in a bank account secured only up to $250k. Poor risk and financial management from VC's and the start-up execs - will they learn from this, probably not. 

VC's and Equity investors can also look at their investments, evaluate the winners and losers and pick and choose which to continue floating through this period. Thats  how Capitalism works. Anyone pushing for a bailout is necessary to protect individual workers is completely disengenuous to the situation- fundementally the risk has been predictable to anyone who chose to review SVB's financial statements and there is no reason at all for tax payers to bail out VC's for execrising poor oversight of their investments. Must've missed the disclaimer that investing is inherently risky and carries the chance of a loss of investment while spending all day reviewing start-ups and investments to park their venture capital into...that must be embarassing. 

And no, Bill Akerman is entirely off the mark that this will cause a run on regional banks Monday AM, the fucking loony.","{'neg': 0.122, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.9376}",Negative,,,,,,

9,"The Fed screwed this up long ago. 

From 2012 to 2020 basically rates were so minimal that money was cheap. 

More cheap money so people bought stuff and the economy was “great” . Typical Americans happy. 

Covid hits and the Fed has no where to go so the govt dumps piles of money into the economy. Typical americas get low balled and corporations get excessive money. Typical corporations very happy and typically Americans somehow think they hit the lotto. 

This starts inflation though the inflation being experienced now seems to result in massive corporate profits.  Typical corporations and shareholders happy. Typical Americans wondering how an egg cost $$ now. 

Corporations seeing an opportunity keep the prices high for themselves and the shareholders. Typical Americans screwed and eggs overtake cocaine in value. Drug cartel not happy. 

Corporations keep raising prices because why not, blame it on inflation. Typical Americans screwed more time but cartels see an opening with depressed Americans buying more product so they’re happy. 

Fed needs to tame inflation more and raises rates again and again. Typical Americans screwed even more while corporations and shareholders rejoice. 

Fast forward a year. 

Idiots at this bank can’t manage wiping their own asses and buy a usually safe instrument on the low end. Investors aware. 

Fed increases rates more and the investment is dog poop. Investors not finally not happy. 

VCs smell blood in the water and pounce in typical style to screw over anyone that’s not them. VC happy everyone else screwed. 

Bank drops a duce and that’s that when the call for a govt bailout are heard and typical Americans are screwed, investors unsure, VC firms that started the run could give a shit and corporations somehow will use this to further increase prices while them and some VC swoop in on potential fire sale ventures.
